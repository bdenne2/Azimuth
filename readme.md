Azimuth 0.1 - Minecraft Compass Plugin
=======================================

This [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) plugin allows players holding compasses to change where the compass points. Right clicking with a compass in hand will change the mode and send a message to the player.

Available modes:
----------------
	World spawn -- Points to the current world's spawn point
	Personal spawn -- Points to where player last spawned. Does not currently change if player sleeps in bed
	Last death -- Points to last location of death. This is set after the user dies.

Changelog:
----------
  * Three modes created
  * Multiple players with individual settings supported
  * Basic features implemented
